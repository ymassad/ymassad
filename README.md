Hello

My name is Yacoub Massad. I am a Software Architect/Developer working at Zeva International. I develop software using C# and .NET.

I am very interested in learning and teaching others about coding principles and practices that aim at creating maintainable software.

You can see my blog here: [criticalsoftwareblog.com](https://criticalsoftwareblog.com).

I recently started a youtube channel about Roslyn, the C# compiler. Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKUnsjTO9KRlNzJoLv3KmDQ) to see the channel: Learn Roslyn by example.

I am also the creator of [DIVEX](https://divex.dev), a dependency injection tool that allows you to compose objects and functions in C# in a way that makes your code more maintainable.
